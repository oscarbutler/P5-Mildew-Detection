# Mildew Detection

## Data Collection

In the start of data collection it is crucial to install kaggle. It is important because we need the dataset in order to make a prediction. As well as recieving the dataset in data collection we also need to configure the kaggle.json file.

## Data Visualisation

## Modelling and evaluating

Train - healthy: 1472 images
Train - powdery_mildew: 1472 images
Validation - healthy: 210 images
Validation - powdery_mildew: 210 images
Test - healthy: 422 images
Test - powdery_mildew: 422 images

## Business Requirements

- The client wants to be able to visualise the difference between the healthy and powdered mildew leaves.

- There should also be a prediction on whether a leaf is healthy or has got powdered mildew.

- It also needs to have a working dashboard.
